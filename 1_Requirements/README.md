# Introduction
Some of the accidents occur due to rear-end collision of the vehicles. The drivers can be notified by the upcoming vehicles that are coming at the back. This is the major reason for the rear end accidents. Rear end accidents are prevented by using ultrasonic sensor kept at the back of the vehicle. When a vehicle tries to hit the back side, the information is diplayed in the LCD Display. The distance between the vehicles is sensed by the ultrasonic sensor. Measuring distance between vehicles helps to avoid collision and severe damages.

# Software Used
* SimulIDE
# Components Description
## Arduino Microcontroller
* The Arduino Board is indeed an ATmega328-based microcontroller board
* It executes all the operations that are to be performed
## Ultrasonic Sensor
* Ultrasonic sensor is fundamentally used to decide the distance between the objective article and the sensor
* The ultrasonic sensor has a monitoring range of 20 mm to 4000 mm
## LCD Display
* LCD stands for Liquid Crystal Display
* Liquid Crystal Displays have materials, which combine the properties of both liquid and crystals
# SWOT Analysis

## Strengths
* User friendly and easy to implement
* Displays the distance of the back objects
## Weakness
* Implementation of existing system
## Opportunity
* Can be implemented in vehicles to monitor the distance of the vehicles behind
* Can also be used as an alert in order to avoid collision of vehicles
## Threats
