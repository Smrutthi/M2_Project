# Introduction
Transportation systems play a vital role in human life. But the population increases day by day.So the transportation also increases rapidly due to migration, trading, moving of people from one place to other. Accident hazards on the road include dangers to the driver, passengers, and other road users while both business and leisure driving. Some of the accidents occur due to rear-end collision of the vehicles. The drivers can be notified by the upcoming vehicles that are coming at the back. This is the major reason for the rear end accidents. Rear end accidents are prevented by using ultrasonic sensor kept at the back of the vehicle. When a vehicle tries to hit the back side, the information is diplayed in the LCD Display. The distance between the vehicles is sensed by the ultrasonic sensor. Measuring distance between vehicles helps to avoid collision and severe damages.

# Research
Due to increased transportation rate, the number of accidents increased by a rate of 22.5%. Approximately 377 people die every day. According to a Global Status report, 1.35 million are dying across the world. 11% alone being accounted for by India. As per the Report on Road accidents in India 2019, the accident-related deaths in India in 2019 were 1,51,113 in number. In order to reduce the accident rate, monitoring of distance behind the vehicle can help to avoid rear-end collision.
# Software Used
* SimulIDE
# Components Description
## Arduino Microcontroller
* The Arduino Board is indeed an ATmega328-based microcontroller board
* It executes all the operations that are to be performed
## Ultrasonic Sensor
* Ultrasonic sensor is fundamentally used to decide the distance between the objective article and the sensor
* The ultrasonic sensor has a monitoring range of 20 mm to 4000 mm
## LCD Display
* LCD stands for Liquid Crystal Display
* Liquid Crystal Displays have materials, which combine the properties of both liquid and crystals
## Buzzer
* A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric.
# SWOT Analysis

## Strengths
* User friendly and easy to implement
* Displays the distance of the back objects
## Weakness
* Implementation of existing system
## Opportunity
* Can be implemented in vehicles to monitor the distance of the vehicles behind
* Can also be used as an alert in order to avoid collision of vehicles
## Threats
* Similar applications are available
# 4W's and 1'H
## Who
This project can be useful for vehicle drivers to know about the distance between the vehicle coming back
## What
This project measures the distance between two vehicles to avoid collision
## Why
This project is useful in order to avoid rear-end collision of vehicles
## When
